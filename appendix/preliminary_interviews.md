# Preliminary Interviews

As part of the preliminary phase of this research, four semi-structured interviews were conducted with adults who were either diagnosed with ADHD or suspect they might have it, comprising three women and one man.  
These interviews, carried out remotely in Portuguese, aimed to gather qualitative insights into the participants' lived experiences. The objective was to explore how the interviewees perceive the interplay between ADHD symptoms, gender, and communication.  
**The findings below reflect their self-reported experiences, perspectives, and observations.** This qualitative input forms the foundation for understanding potential linguistic and cognitive markers that could inform improved diagnostic and support frameworks.  
The semi-structured ADHD interview guide is included in **Appendix A**.

## Participant 1

The analysis of Participant 1's interview, a young adult female, provided nuanced insights into the intersection of ADHD symptoms, communication strategies, and gender norms. The findings are as follows:

- **Narrative Shifts and Attention Challenges:**  
  The participant reported frequently changing topics mid-conversation, reflecting challenges with maintaining a linear narrative. This trait, while aiding their mental organization, often confused others. Forgetfulness, such as losing their train of thought mid-sentence, was another prominent pattern, highlighting attention lapses.

- **Gender Norms and Expression:**  
  Socially constructed expectations significantly shaped her communication:
  - **Inhibition:** Norms like “women shouldn’t speak loudly” suppressed natural impulsivity and hyperactivity during childhood.  
  - **Judgment:** Forgetfulness or conversational slips were met with heightened scrutiny, leading to self-monitoring and mental strain.  
  In adulthood, the participant began reconciling previously suppressed behaviors, such as speaking loudly or whistling, with her identity.

- **Communication Style:**  
  When discussing topics of interest, the participant revealed she spoke quickly and with enthusiasm, while adjusting tone and pace to meet social expectations. She also felt the need to overexplain ideas to avoid misunderstandings, though this was sometimes perceived as condescension.

- **Late Diagnosis and Gendered Challenges:**  
  A delayed ADHD diagnosis stemmed from societal tendencies to overlook internalized symptoms in women. The participant noted boys with ADHD are often granted more freedom to express impulsivity, underscoring gendered disparities in ADHD recognition.

## Participant 2

The analysis of Participant 2's interview, a young adult female, shed further light on the complexities of ADHD-related communication challenges and the influence of gender norms on self-expression. Key insights are detailed below:

- **Shifts in Conversation and Forgetfulness:**  
  The participant reported frequently shifting topics and revisiting previous subjects, reflecting her thought process but making conversations difficult to follow. Forgetting her train of thought mid-sentence was a common issue, which led her to speak rapidly to keep pace with her ideas. However, this created difficulties when interacting with those who spoke more slowly.

- **Interruptions and Enthusiasm:**  
  Frequent interruptions, driven by enthusiasm and a desire to contribute, were described, though the participant also acknowledged struggling to moderate these impulses during engaging discussions.

- **Gender Norms and Communication Pressure:**  
  Social expectations constrained her communication style. The participant felt pressured to speak softly and discreetly, and expressions of enthusiasm were often misinterpreted as “hysterical” or “dramatic,” reflecting broader societal biases.

- **Challenges with Validation and Feminine Identity:**  
  The participant faced difficulties in being taken seriously, particularly in discussions about personal experiences or feminist topics. She also reflected on childhood disconnection from traditional feminine activities, which led to feelings of alienation and complexity regarding her gender identity.

- **Gestures and Emotional Expression:**  
  The participant acknowledged using physical gestures, such as hand motions, to help organize her thoughts and express herself. These actions also served as emotional outlets.

- **Sensitivity to Rejection:**  
  A heightened sensitivity to misunderstanding or rejection was revealed, especially in familial and intimate relationships, where the participant often felt the need to justify her emotions and reactions.

- **Underdiagnosis and Gendered Disparities:**  
  Like other participants, this individual experienced delayed diagnosis due to the internalization of symptoms, with the societal tendency to overlook ADHD in women contributing to gendered disparities in recognition and treatment.

## Participant 3

Participant 3, a male young adult with ADHD, provided insights into communicational and behavioral adaptations, offering a comparative perspective on gendered differences in the expression of ADHD traits. Significant observations include:

- **Topic Changes and Forgetfulness:**  
  The participant reported frequently shifting topics mid-conversation, often while adding contextual details. Although this caused occasional listener confusion, it was generally socially accepted. Forgetting conversational points due to a mismatch between mental processing speed and verbal expression was a recurring challenge, which was alleviated when others helped refocus discussions.

- **Rapid Speech and Overexplaining:**  
  To keep pace with his thoughts, the participant stated he spoke quickly but felt his cognition still outpaced verbal output. This sometimes resulted in disorganized reasoning. He also noted how he tended to overexplain ideas, occasionally leading to misunderstandings, such as being perceived as condescending in professional settings.

- **Masculine Behavioral Norms:**  
  The participant observed that societal norms allowed him to express hyperactive traits like animated gestures and elevated tones without significant criticism. He was conscious that this acceptance enabled him to externalize hyperactivity more comfortably compared to women with ADHD.

- **Enthusiasm and Social Adaptations:**  
  Heightened enthusiasm in discussions led to interruptions and louder speech. While self-aware of this behavior, he made efforts to adjust his tone and pace based on social feedback, maintaining harmony in varied contexts.

- **Mood Fluctuations and Frustration Management:**  
  Sudden mood spikes and anger during gaming or repetitive scenarios were described but were generally short-lived and well-managed. Cumulative irritation was more prominent in slower-paced interactions or during misunderstandings.

- **Navigating Slow Conversations:**  
  While preferring fast-paced exchanges, the participant adapted to slower interactions but sometimes became internally distracted or disengaged.

- **Challenges with Handwriting:**  
  Handwriting posed a consistent difficulty, requiring structured review and revision, particularly for academic or professional tasks.

- **Comparison with Peers:**  
  Reflecting on his hyperactivity relative to peers and a sibling with ADHD provided insight into his behaviors within familial and broader social contexts.

## Participant 4

The fourth participant, an adult female who suspects she has ADHD but has not been formally diagnosed, provided insights that highlight the challenges of navigating symptoms without confirmation of the condition. Her experiences also underscore the potential for late recognition of ADHD in women and the impact of societal expectations on behavior. Relevant findings include:

- **Masked Hyperactivity and Inattention:**  
  The participant reported reserving intense hyperactivity for private moments, likening it to a “manic state.” Childhood academic success masked inattentiveness, but tasks requiring prolonged focus, like driving, revealed fragmented attention.

- **Task Hesitation and Sensory Sensitivities:**  
  The participant described often delaying initiating complex tasks due to fear of dependency or judgment. Sensory sensitivities, particularly to auditory and tactile stimuli, heightened distress during unexpected disruptions.

- **Gender Norms and Perceived Expertise:**  
  While feeling less direct gender pressure than other interviewed females, her youthful appearance led to judgments of inexperience.

- **Social Anxiety and Public Self-Control:**  
  Public mistakes heightened anxiety, reinforcing a tendency to self-censor. Overexplaining to avoid miscommunication was misinterpreted as stubbornness, reflecting her need to be understood.

- **Mood Fluctuations and Fatigue:**  
  Irritation with interruptions and internalized anger were described as common, resulting in emotional fatigue and diminished impulsivity over time. Fatigue also reduced her energy for debates and self-monitoring.

- **Processing and Writing Challenges:**  
  The participant preferred fast-paced interactions and visual aids, finding writing especially challenging due to a mismatch between thought speed and articulation ability. These difficulties persisted from childhood into adulthood.

- **Delayed Diagnosis:**  
  Despite suspecting ADHD for years, she refrained from seeking diagnosis due to societal pressures and effective masking, exemplifying how women often delay pursuing confirmation.

## Conclusions

The interviews provided valuable perspectives on the varied manifestations of ADHD symptoms, highlighting their intersection with societal norms and the coping strategies individuals employ.  
While each participant offered unique insights, several common themes emerged, including frequent shifts in conversation topics, interruptions, and rapid speech—behaviors often driven by attempts to synchronize verbal expression with fast-paced cognitive processing.  
The use of gestures and physical movements as tools for organizing thoughts was another shared trait, underlining the role of embodied strategies in communication. Forgetfulness and losing one's train of thought were also recurrent challenges.

Gender norms heavily influenced the communication experiences of the female participants, with expectations to exhibit restraint, particularly in expressing enthusiasm or strong emotions.  
These pressures frequently led to self-monitoring and suppressed behaviors in childhood, which some participants actively worked to unlearn as adults.  
Conversely, Participant 3, a male, noted societal acceptance of behaviors like animated gestures and elevated tones, enabling a freer externalization of hyperactivity.

The impact of underdiagnosis and masking was a significant theme among the female participants, illustrating how societal biases and internalized symptoms delay ADHD recognition in women.  
In contrast, Participant 3 did not indicate a late diagnosis but reflected on navigating ADHD symptoms in familial and social contexts.  
Emotional regulation, particularly sensitivity to rejection and frustration, further emerged as a consistent challenge, highlighting the emotional toll of ADHD in interpersonal relationships.

These findings emphasize the need for greater awareness of ADHD’s gendered dimensions and the value of exploring individual linguistic patterns.  
The interviews not only deepened understanding of ADHD’s diverse manifestations but also underscored the importance of creating supportive environments to accommodate varied neurodivergent experiences.
