# Questionnaire Validation with Psychometric Evidence by Professor Paula Ferreira, PhD (Psychology)

The questionnaire was validated for exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis so that future studies can carry out additional analyses, such as pre- and post-tests, following the dimensions/factors that emerged from this analysis.  
The exploratory factor analysis was conducted using **IBM SPSS 30** and the confirmatory factor analysis with **IBM AMOS 30**.

## Exploratory Factor Analysis

Exploratory Factor Analysis results of the instrument (**N = 250**, convenience sample collected online) yielded a **five-factor structure**, retained with parallel analysis.  
The first five real-data eigenvalues (λ₁ = 13.03 to λ₅ = 1.64) exceeded the 95th percentile of random data, suggesting a robust factor solution (Timmerman & Lorenzo-Seva, 2011).

Using **oblique (Promax) rotation**, a theoretically consistent structure was revealed for 48 observed variables, identifying five factors:

1. *Shifting & Interruptions* (Factor 1)  
2. *Argumentativeness & Talkback* (Factor 2)  
3. *Swearing & Coarse Language* (Factor 3)  
4. *Emotional Reactivity & Mood* (Factor 4)  
5. *Fast Talk & Urgency* (Factor 5)

The model demonstrated robust goodness-of-fit indices:

- NNFI = 0.959  
- CFI = 0.967  
- GFI = 0.971  
- RMSEA = 0.055 (95% CI [0.053, 0.055])  

These results suggest acceptable to good model fit, with the close-fit test corroborating a reasonable approximation to the population’s covariance structure (*p = 0.04*).  
Reliability and factor determinacy were high (**ORION = 0.808–0.943**, **FD = 0.899–0.971**), and primary factor loadings were statistically robust (Bootstrap 95% CIs excluding zero).

### Table 1. Factor Descriptive Statistics and Inter-Factor Correlation Matrix (Promax Oblique Rotation)

| **Factor**                          | **Mean** | **SD** | **Alpha** | **1**    | **2**    | **3**    | **4**    |
|------------------------------------|:--------:|:------:|:----------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| 1. Shifting & Interruptions         | 3.16 | 0.96 | 0.97 |          |          |          |          |
| 2. Argumentativeness & Talkback     | 3.48 | 0.71 | 0.93 | 0.364*   |          |          |          |
| 3. Swearing & Coarse Language       | 2.66 | 0.83 | 0.90 | 0.243*   | -0.026   |          |          |
| 4. Emotional Reactivity & Mood      | 2.73 | 0.90 | 0.91 | 0.398*   | 0.209    | 0.099    |          |
| 5. Fast Talk & Urgency              | 2.47 | 0.82 | 0.95 | 0.540*   | 0.257*   | 0.211*   | 0.453*   |

*Note.* *Indicates correlation significantly different from zero at the population level (BCa 95% CI excluding zero).*

Moderate positive inter-factor correlations were observed, notably between:

- Factor 1 (*Shifting & Interruptions*) and Factor 5 (*Fast Talk & Urgency*), *r = 0.54*  
- Factor 4 (*Emotional Reactivity & Mood*) and Factor 5 (*Fast Talk & Urgency*), *r = 0.45*

These results support the use of **oblique rotation** and suggest that while the factors are distinct, they are interrelated dimensions of the *Communication, Impulsivity, and Reactivity Questionnaire*, providing robust evidence for subsequent Confirmatory Factor Analysis.

## Confirmatory Factor Analysis

Given the limited sample size (**N = 107**, convenience sample collected online), the original factor model was simplified through **item parcelling**, a technique used to reduce the number of estimated parameters and improve model convergence—especially recommended for small-sample SEM (Bandalos, 2002; Little et al., 2002).

The resulting Confirmatory Factor Analysis model comprised a **single latent factor** measured by five parcels corresponding to the factors identified in the Exploratory Factor Analysis:

- *Shifting & Interruptions*  
- *Argumentativeness & Talkback*  
- *Swearing & Coarse Language*  
- *Emotional Reactivity & Mood*  
- *Fast Talk & Urgency*

The model demonstrated **excellent fit** to the data:

- χ²(4) = 2.984, *p = 0.560*  
- CMIN/DF = 0.746  
- CFI = 1.000  
- RMSEA = 0  

All five parcels were statistically significant indicators of the latent construct (loadings ranging from 0.371 to 1.13, *p = 0.007*), providing **strong support** for the factor structure of the measure as captured by the parcelled items.
